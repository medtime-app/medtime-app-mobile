# ⚠️ Important Notice: Android App Limitations on Replit

This repository contains a **native Android mobile application** that **cannot be run on Replit**.

## Why This App Won't Run on Replit

Replit is designed for:
- ✅ Web applications (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- ✅ Backend APIs (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- ✅ Command-line tools
- ✅ Desktop applications (with VNC)

However, Android apps require:
- ❌ Android SDK (not available on Replit)
- ❌ Android emulator or physical device (not supported on Replit)
- ❌ Android build tools and platform-specific components

## Recommended Development Environments

To work with this Android application, use one of these platforms:

### 1. **Android Studio** (Best Option)
- Official IDE for Android development
- Built-in emulator and debugging tools
- Download: https://developer.android.com/studio

### 2. **IntelliJ IDEA** with Android Plugin
- Alternative to Android Studio
- Same underlying platform with Android support

### 3. **VS Code** with Android Extensions
- Lightweight option
- Requires separate Android SDK installation

## What You Can Do on Replit

If you want to work with this codebase on Replit, you could:
1. **Review and edit the code** (but not run it)
2. **Create documentation** for the project
3. **Refactor or analyze** the code structure
4. **Build a web version** of this app using a web framework

## Converting to a Web Application

If you'd like to create a web version of this medication tracker, I can help you:
- Build a React, Vue, or vanilla JavaScript frontend
- Create a backend API with Node.js, Python, or another language
- Use PostgreSQL database instead of SQLite/Room
- Deploy it on Replit with a live URL
